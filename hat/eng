Dudu’s Hat

2
“Hey, Dudu,” Dumisani says. “I bet you can’t throw your hat through that window.”

3
Dudu looks up at the open window. It’s so high up the classroom wall, she can’t see what’s on the other side.

4
“OK,” says Dudu. “I’ll count to three.” They take their hats off and stand ready. “One...” says Dudu slowly, “two”... “THREE!”

5
Dudu and Dumisani throw their hats towards the window. Dudu’s hat lands softly against the wall and slides down onto the shelf underneath. But Dumisani’s hat gets close. It hits the windowsill and rebounds, turning three times in the air before coming to rest on the head of the stuffed rhino below.

6
Dudu and Dumisani laugh so hard, Dudu has to hold her tummy. “Again!” she says.

7
The friends fetch their hats, and Dumisani counts, “One, two, three!” Dumisani’s hat sails through the air, makes it past the windowsill, bumps against the frame and falls through the window. “YES!” he shouts. Dudu’s hat is on the shelf again.

8
“Do it again,” Dumisani says to Dudu. Dudu gets her hat, balls it up in her hand and squints at the window. “One, two, three,” says Dumisani, and Dudu throws. But her hat bounces off the windowsill and slides down the wall again. "AGAIN" says Dumisani

9
“Uh uh,” says Dudu. “Let’s go outside to the swings.” She fetches her hat and puts it firmly on her head. “Ah, please, Dudu?” says Dumisani. “Here, I’ll help you.”

10
“Point your other hand at the window,” he says. “Now throw from your shoulder.” Dudu takes a deep breath and throws. He takes Dudu’s hat from her head, balls it up, and puts it in her hand. Her hat swoops up, opens like a gliding bird, flies through the window, and disappears.


11
“Yes!” Dudu and Dumisani shout, lifting their arms in victory.

“TEACHER!” Dudu shouts to Teacher Lethabo. “Our hats fell out the window!”
