BRAVE BORA

2
Bora is sitting at the clinic with Baba. Jojo, his stuffed monkey, came too. Jojo is sleeping in Bora’s bag.

3
“I don’t like needles. They hurt!” says Bora.

4
“An injection helps make you healthy. It’s okay to be scared, Bora. Baba will be right here with you. And Jojo too.”

5
“Bora Baraka!” a loud voice calls. “Let’s go Bora,” says Baba. “It’s your turn.” “Let’s come back tomorrow Baba!” says Bora.

6
“Remember what Baba said you will get for being brave enough to get your injection?” asks Baba. “A red lollipop! Okay, I’m coming,” says Bora.

7
The doctor smiles at Bora. “Is this your monkey? Can we examine him too?” she asks. Bora looks at Baba, then at Jojo, and nods.

8
“Now, it’s your turn,” she says. Will you help me give your monkey a small injection so he feels better?” asks the doctor.

9
“TOOP!” says the doctor as she gives Jojo the monkey an injection.

10
“Now, it’s your turn. Is that a superhero on your T-shirt?” she asks. “TOOP!” she says as she gives Bora the injection.

11
“Ouch!” shouts Bora. “Hey, that wasn’t so bad!"

12
“I know it stings a little, but we’re done and you have been very brave!” says the doctor.

13
“One red lollipop for our brave Bora!”
